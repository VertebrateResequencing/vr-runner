The vr-runner package provides a lightweight pipeline framework.

Runner pipelines
----------------
The runner pipelines are usually named as `run-something`. This document uses
`run-st-mpileup` as an example, but the usage is the same for all runners. 

For the impatient
-----------------
The minimum commands sufficient to install and run the pipelines is:

    # Get the code
    git clone git://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/vr-runner.git

    # Create a config file, edit, and run
    run-st-mpileup +sampleconf > my.conf
    vim my.conf
    run-st-mpileup +config my.conf +loop 600 -o outdir

Important: see also the section about setting environment variables below!

In more detail
--------------
The Runner.pm pipelines have two types of options. The options prefixed by `+` are common to all runners, the options prefixed by `-` are pipeline specific. For a complete list of the options run with `-h`, the output of which is shown at the bottom of this page

    run-st-mpileup -h

The pipelines can be run in a daemon mode (turned on by giving the `+loop` option) or they can do one iteration only and stop (`+loop` option not given). The latter is suitable for execution from cron. Because the runner script itself consumes close to zero CPU time and memory, it can be run on farm head nodes. In this mode, it is convenient to run it from screen. For details about how to use screen see the manual pages (man screen), but generally knowing the following is enough:

  * Launch a new screen by executing the command `screen`
  * Type enter and run whatever commands you like. (In our case it will be the run-st-mpileup command.)
  * Detach from the screen by pressing `ctrl+a` followed by `d`
  * At any time one can reattach to a running screen by executing `screen -r`

If the farm has multiple head nodes, note that the screen lives on a concrete computer and therefore one has to log into the exact same machine to access it. One can simultaneously run as many screens as necessary.

Note that it is not necessary (nor recommended) to submit the runner scripts to the farm as they take little CPU and memory. Nonetheless, if the pipeline is run this way, the exit status is 111 when successfully completed. 

Setting environment variables
-----------------------------
The `vr-wrapper` script can be used to set environment variables without having
to change user's profile. It may look like this:

    #!/bin/bash
    export PATH="$HOME/git/vr-runner/scripts:$PATH"
    export PERL5LIB="$HOME/git/vr-runner/modules:$PERL5LIB"

Save the config in the file, say `~/.vrw/runners` and use like this:

    vr-wrapper ~/.vrw/runners run-st-mpileup +config my.conf +loop 600 -o outdir


Chaining multiple runners
-------------------------
Multiple runners can be chained together using the `run-runners` pipeline manager. It runs as a daemon or from `cron` and waits for a new project to appear in a dropbox directory. After completion of the project, the results appear in output directory and the user is notified by an email. Multiple users can use the same dropbox setup to run different pipelines at the same time.

The following directory structure is used:

    prefix.conf .. config directory which contains pipeline definitions. 
                    Typically this is a symbolic link to the vr-runner/misc
                    install directory.  This is the only requirement, the rest
                    is created automatically by the pipeline
    prefix.in   .. dropbox input directory, drop your project here
    prefix.out  .. output directory, the result will appear here
    prefix.tmp  .. working directory

Each pipeline chain consists of a series of steps defined in the `chain.*.conf` and `step.*.conf` files. For examples take a look in the `misc` directory of this distribution. Configs files in this direcotry can be used directly as they are, just symlink them as described above in the description of `prefix.conf`. If the config files are well written, the user only needs to create a small project description and place it in the dropbox input directory:

    config:          chain.gtcheck.conf
    email:           someone\@somewhere.org
    mpileup/alns:    bams.list
    mpileup/fa_ref:  human_g1k_v37.fasta

The project descriptions are small text files which define the input data:
 
    # The pipeline config, known also as the "chain file". Note that in order to
    # avoid the execution of an arbitrary code passed by a malicious user, the config
    # must be a file name with any leading directory components removed. The file
    # must exist in the dropbox config directory:
    config: chain.pipeline.conf
 
    # The rest is optional and pipeline-specific. There are a few pipeline-wide 
    # options that are recognised by all pipelines, such as where to send email 
    # notifications about job completion and failures:
    email: someone@somewhere.org
 
    # Frequency (in minutes) with which to remind about failed jobs, so that
    # the mailbox does not end up cluttered by emails. If not given, the default
    # of 60 minutes is used:
    err_period: 60
 
    # Any key in a runner's config file can be overriden. For example, if a pipeline
    # chain includes a runner step named "step_name" which recognises the config 
    # key "var_name", the default key can be overriden as:
    step_name/var_name: new value
 
    # Similarly, substrings in a runner's config file can be expanded. For example,
    # if the config contains the following key-value pair
    #   key => 'some $(value)',
    # the variable "$(value)" can be replaced with "new value":
    step_name/value: new value
  
    # Note: if the project description does not specify the "step_name/value" key,
    # the variable "$(value)" will be replaced with "value".
 
    # In order to preserve compactness of project descriptions yet allowing flexibility,
    # the runner's config files can use default values. For example, if the config
    # contains the following key-value pair
    #   key => 'some $(value:sensible default)',
    # the project description file can override the value but in case it does not,
    # the key will be expanded as follows
    #   key => 'some sensible default',
    #
    # See the misc/*conf files for real-life examples.
 
The pipeline chain can be run from the command line:
 
    run-runners -v -d prefix            # one iteration
    run-runners -v -d prefix -l 300     # loop with sleep cycles of 300 seconds
 
or from cron:
 
    */5 *  *   *   *     vr-wrapper ~/.vrw/runners 'run-runners -v -d prefix -L config.lock'    
 
The vr-wrapper scripts can be used to set environment variables without having to change user's profile. It may look like this:
 
    #!/bin/bash
    export PATH="$HOME/git/vr-runner/scripts:$PATH"
    export PERL5LIB="$HOME/git/vr-runner/modules:$PERL5LIB"

Frequently (and not so frequently) asked questions
--------------------------------------------------
<dl>
<dt>How to rerun a task</dt>
<dd>The pipelines know that a task finished by checking the existence of checkpoint files. In order to reduce the number of stat calls, the pipeline keeps a cache of finished tasks. Therefore, to rerun a task, it is not enough to remove the specific checkpoin file, one has to tell the pipeline to ignore the cached status: run the pipeline as usual, but add the <b>+nocache</b> option.
</dd>

<dt>How to skip a job</dt>
<dd>If a task keeps failing, the pipeline can be told to skip the offending task by setting negative value of the <b>+retries</b> option. With negative value of +retries, a skip file with the ".s" suffix is created and the job is reported as finished. The skip files are cleaned automatically when +retries is set to a positive value. A non cleanable variant is a force skip ".fs" file which is never cleaned by the pipeline and is created/removed manually by the user. When .fs is cleaned by the user, the pipeline must be run with +nocache in order to notice the change.
</dd>

<dt>Kill all running jobs</dt>
<dd>When something goes wrong and all jobs must be killed, the <b>+kill</b> option does the trick.
</dd>
